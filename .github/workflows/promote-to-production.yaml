# Play Store Release Promotion Workflow
# =====================================

# Purpose:
# - Automate the process of promoting beta releases to production on Google Play Store
# - Streamline the app release management workflow
# - Ensure consistent and reliable deployment of Android applications

# Workflow Overview:
# - Handles the transition of a beta version to full production release
# - Uses Fastlane for deployment automation
# - Configures necessary credentials and environments for Play Store publishing

# Key Features:
# - Reusable workflow callable from other workflows
# - Runs on macOS runner (optimal for iOS and Android deployments)
# - Configures Ruby and Fastlane environment
# - Securely manages Play Store credentials
# - Supports multiple Fastlane plugins for enhanced functionality

# Prerequisites:
# - Fastlane installed and configured
# - Fastlane plugins:
#   * firebase_app_distribution
#   * increment_build_number
# - Play Store service account credentials
# - Existing beta version of the app ready for promotion

# Deployment Process:
# 1. Check out repository code
# 2. Set up Ruby environment
# 3. Install Fastlane and required plugins
# 4. Inflate Play Store credentials
# 5. Promote beta version to production

# Security Considerations:
# - Uses GitHub Secrets for credential management
# - Temporary credential file created during workflow
# - Limited number of upload retries to prevent potential issues

# Workflow Characteristics:
# - Configurable maximum upload retries
# - Uses bundler for dependency management
# - Supports modular deployment configuration via Fastlane

# Potential Use Cases:
# - Automated monthly app releases
# - Continuous deployment for mobile applications
# - Consistent app version management
